      I have always loved swimming ever since I was young, I swam in highschool.<br>My favorite swimm style was freestyle but I also liked breast stroke, <br>my
      fastest time in the 50 yard sprint was 23.9 second. I also swam a little bit in college as well.

     I Really enjoy playing video games. I play games mostly for the competitve aspect. I like playing ranked <br> and seeing how good I can get, my favorite competitive game is league of legends but my most nogstalgic<br> game is runescape, I used to go over and sleepover at my friends house when we were young and <br> play as late as we could stay up.

      Camping and Hiking is always fun. Alot of my hobbies are on the computer and so <br> it is always nice to get a break and go outside. I grew up in norther <br> California and I really enjoy being in nature. I like being surrounded by trees<br> and near water.

   <P class="codytext">
    I Like watching anime and as you can tell by the image to the right my favorite anime is One Piece. <br> It is a really long anime with over 1000 episodes that are still being made but it is a really <br> great adventure and story if you have the time to watch or read it!
